Make a basic engine that uses Lua Scripts to do actions.  Ideally, new lua scripts should be added
in a way that does not require the source or a recompile, but not necessary.

Here is a list of ideas:

1.  	You have a fake-terminal-interface (FTI) created with C++. The user is given a task to do, and they
	must use given utilities (Lua scripts) to solve it.
2.	Create a tool that can organize files or the contents of a text file based on what Lua script is used
3.	Make a **basic** rpg that uses C++ to run Lua scripts that interact with the engine.
