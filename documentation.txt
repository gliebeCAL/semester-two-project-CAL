	*Learning more about C++
	*Looking into CMake
02-04-15:
	*Finished Plan
	*Updated **README.md** and created code-challenges
02-06-15:

	*Had Network issues during class, unable to do much until the end of class
02-10-15:
	*Reconfiguring work environment
02-12-15:
	*Reviewing C++
02-15-15:
	*Learning make system
	*Setting up make system for mini project
	*Created example project
	*Make system functional
	*Continuing to review C++
02-17-15:
	*Continuing to review C++
02-19-15:
	*Reviewing C++ the sequal the sequal
02-20-15:
	*Starting a coding challenge
	*Completed Coderbyte_Challenge_1
02-23-15:
	*Did research on the String class in C++
02-25-15:
	*Brainstorming ideas for the main project in **brainstorm.txt**
	*Started working on a new challenge
03-02-15:
	*Looking into logbooks for this project (useful for documentation and comprehension)
	*Created an idea in **brainstorm.txt**
	*Fixed spelling of "chalenge" to "challenge"
	*Completed dailyprogrammer203 challenge
03-03-15:
	*Created a directory for mini-project-1 and mini-project-2
	*Wrote out **README.md** files for both projects
	*Repaired Makefile for both mini-projects
	*Doing more work on **brainstorm.txt**
03-05-15:
	*Changed /src directory structure (contains /lua and /cpp)
	*Changed Makefile to reflect changes in /src directory changes
03-10-15:
	*Working on Mini-Project-1 (lua, integration, etc.)
03-16-15:
	*Reserching people's experiences with C++ and Lua integration
	*Clarified goal of final project in **brainstorm.txt**
03-20-15:
	*Added more to **brainstorm.txt**
03-24-15:
	*Running into Lua issues (not wanting to compile)
	*Compliler claimes that luaL_open(L); is not being referenced
	*Unable to find the issue so far
03-27-15:
	*Made a brief change to the README
	*Deleated Mini-Project-2 because it was not necessary
	*Fixed another misspelling of 'chalenge' in README.md
03-30-15:
	*FINALLY DISCOVERED MY ISSUES (lua embedded files not compiling)
	*Removed lua from the system, and now in the process of manually installing it
	*Lua manually installed, and can now be properly linked to
	*Still unable to manually declare a state and open files
	*Decision: Trying out Luabind in order to make the lua state process easier
	*Decision: The Semester Project will be to make a basic game that has all low level stuff handled by
	 C++, and everything higher leveled (eg. weapons, animations, etc.) happen in Lua.  Compromises can
	 be made with regards to using Lua for everything if necessary
	*Cleaned up README.md and added more information
	*NOTE TO SELF: Go to www.rasterbar.com/products/luabind.html to try this method
03-31-15:
	*Researching a new method to bind Lua to C++
04-01-15:
	*Determined that Luabind is unsuited (depends on boost library)
	*Created a manual Lua binding
	*Repaired Lua library situation
	*Found the correct lua compilation flags
	*Added feature's to Mini-Project-1's Makefile (clean bin, move lua scripts to bin, updated compile command)
	*Updated README.md for Mini-Project-1 (cleaned up messed up markdown)
	*Completed Mini-Project-1
04-03-15:
	*Started working on the Final Project (setting up directories and Makefile)
	*Thinking about starting a challenge (not sure yet; Coderbyte challange 2)
