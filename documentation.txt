02-25-15:
	*Brainstorming ideas for the main project in **brainstorm.txt**

03-02-15:
	*Looking into logbooks for this project (useful for documentation and comprehension)
	*Created an idea in **brainstorm.txt**
	*Fixed spelling of "chalenge" to "challenge"
	*Completed dailyprogrammer203 challenge
03-03-15:
	*Created a directory for mini-project-1 and mini-project-2
	*Wrote out **README.md** files for both projects
	*Repaired Makefile for both mini-projects
	*Doing more work on **brainstorm.txt**
03-05-15:
	*Changed /src directory structure (contains /lua and /cpp)
	*Changed Makefile to reflect changes in /src directory changes
03-10-15:
	*Working on Mini-Project-1 (lua, integration, etc.)
03-16-15:
	*Reserching people's experiences with C++ and Lua integration
	*Clarified goal of final project in **brainstorm.txt**
03-20-15:
	*Added more to **brainstorm.txt**
03-24-15:
	*Running into Lua issues (not wanting to compile)
	*Compliler claimes that luaL_open(L); is not being referenced
	*Unable to find the issue so far
03-27-15:
	*Made a brief change to the README
	*Deleated Mini-Project-2 because it was not necessary
	*Fixed another misspelling of 'chalenge' in README.md
03-30-15:
	*FINALLY DISCOVERED MY ISSUES (lua embedded files not compiling)
	*Removed lua from the system, and now in the process of manually installing it
	*Lua manually installed, and can now be properly linked to
	*Still unable to manually declare a state and open files
	*Decision: Trying out Luabind in order to make the lua state process easier
	*Decision: The Semester Project will be to make a basic game that has all low level stuff handled by
	 C++, and everything higher leveled (eg. weapons, animations, etc.) happen in Lua.  Compromises can
	 be made with regards to using Lua for everything if necessary
	*Cleaned up README.md and added more information
	*NOTE TO SELF: Go to www.rasterbar.com/products/luabind.html to try this method
03-31-15:
	*Researching a new method to bind Lua to C++
04-01-15:
	*Determined that Luabind is unsuited (depends on boost library)
	*Created a manual Lua binding
	*Repaired Lua library situation
	*Found the correct lua compilation flags
	*Added feature's to Mini-Project-1's Makefile (clean bin, move lua scripts to bin, updated compile command)
	*Updated README.md for Mini-Project-1 (cleaned up messed up markdown)
	*Completed Mini-Project-1
04-03-15:
	*Started working on the Final Project (setting up directories and Makefile)
	*Thinking about starting a challenge (not sure yet; Coderbyte challange 2)
04-06-15:
	*Found some examples done with C and Lua (https://github.com/adamwiggins/lua-pong/)
	*Most likely making a text adventure style game at the moment
	*Decided that this is going to be a text adventure game
	*The indev name is Project Ysgramor
04-08-15:
	*Created battle.lua
	*Created design.md for final-project (contains all ideas for the design of systems/gameplay)
	*Currently designing battle.lua
04-10-15:
	*Reading more lua stuff
	*Worked on more design stuff for final-project
	*Created more folders for organization w/ lua files (players, enemies, items), which makes it
	 easy to find and edit the lua files
04-12-15:
	*Cleaned up README.md a bit more
04-14-15:
	*Worked on even more design stuff for final-project
04-16-15:
	*Continuing the necessary work in the design department.  I am spending a good amount of time
	 planning so I do not get off track or bite off more than I can chew.
04-20-15:
	*Worked on Design document more
	*Planning for presentation
04-21-15:
	*Fleshed out more of the design document
04-23-15:
	*Setting up computer again (installed a new system, so taking time to fix things)
04-27-15:
	*Everything is working!  Huzzah!
	*Almost done with design (stuff on enemies and story then done)
	*Added menu.cpp
	*Edited battle.cpp (just the header format)
04-29-15:
	*Started to create the menu for the game in menu.cpp
	*Did some more work on setting up the cpp files
05-01-15:
	*Issue with displaying menu
		*Escape issue ( using \ makes compiler get confused with escaping characters)
		*Now it is not displaying (unsure why)
		*Escaping the characters does not help
		*FIXED ISSUE: The wrong characters were being escaped --- now displays
	*Declarations broken (debugger not stating where error lies)
		*Fixed issue: Typo found in menu.h (wrote like a function, not a declaration) --- properly declared now
	*A (nonfunctional) menu now displays on launch
	*Added new files (clearScreen.cpp and clearScreen.h)
		*clearScreen holds a function that can clear the terminal screen, which will be very useful
	*Started laying out battle.cpp
		*Added success and failure functions
		*Added a function for the start of battle
		*Created a function to be the main loop for the battle
